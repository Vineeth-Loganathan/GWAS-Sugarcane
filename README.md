# GWAS-Sugarcane
This repository contains the workflow, data, and scripts used for conducting a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) on sugarcane varieties. The study integrates genotypic and phenotypic data to identify significant associations between genetic markers and key agronomic traits
Key Features:
Dataset: 600 sugarcane clones with 8 phenotypic traits and genotypic data for 15,000 SNP markers from four varieties, genotyped using the Axiom Sugarcane 100K SNP array.
BLUP Generation: Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs) calculated for traits to improve accuracy in phenotypic measurements.
GWAS Pipeline: Linear regression models to assess SNP-trait associations, extracting coefficients and p-values.
Visualizations: Manhattan and coefficient plots to interpret significant marker-trait associations.
Integration: Marker alignment with the Saccharum hybrid cultivar R570 reference genome and functional annotation of SNPs using publicly available resources.
Objectives:
Identify SNPs and candidate genes related to yield traits.
Understand the genetic basis of trait variation under field conditions evaluated over three years.
Support marker-assisted breeding programs with actionable insights.
This repository aims to contribute to the bioinformatics and plant genomics community by providing reproducible workflows and well-documented analyses.
